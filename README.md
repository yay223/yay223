I'm a PhD scholar at Lehigh University, specializing in computational biophysics.
My research is on understanding and quantifying the mechanisms of cellular processes via Molecular Dynamics simulations.
I have recently developed a keen interest in Machine learning algorithms and their application to Biophysics.

#### My hobbies & interests:

- Building and experimenting with DIY electronics.
- Ricing (I use Arch btw ü§ì‚òù)
- ##### Tinkering:
  - A growing interest in system administration, home servers, and networking.
  - CLI apps
